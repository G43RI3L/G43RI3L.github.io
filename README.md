I did it for the 6 mouths of dating, is a nice surprise, if anyone wishes to copy is just change the name for yours and add the images in the folder.

After you save in the vscode (is what I used) go to the terminal and location of the repository and push:

"
git add .
git commit -m "Final Correction of position and counting"
git push origin main
".

Just reload and you are good to go
